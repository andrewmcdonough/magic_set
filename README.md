# Now magicians always putting things in boxes to see what happens

# First we'll need a box to put stuff in

class Box
  attr_accessor :contents
end

b = Box.new

# And then lets put something inside it, perhaps a glass of water

b.contents = "glass of water"

# As you can see, there is water in the box
puts b.contents

# wave wand
puts b.contents

# Now lets put something else in the box
b.contents = "dove"
puts b.contents

# wave wand again
puts b.contents

# And it's disappeared

# Another trick that magicians like to do, is sawing a women in half.  I feel that's a bit sexist, so I'll saw a man in half instead.  Specifically, Nigel Farage.

# Now I'll represent Nigel as a good old English, beer-drinking String

irb_context.echo = false

man = "Nigel Farage"

# In ruby, it's quite easy to cut things up

man_parts = man.split " "
puts man_parts

# Now I know some of you would like it if I left Nigel that way, but I should really put him back together before the Daily Mail find out.

new_person = man_parts.join " "
